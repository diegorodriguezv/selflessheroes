Take control of a team of heroes who share the same artificial intelligence. It's up to you to create their AI so that they cooperate as best they can.
At the end of each series of puzzles, a boss is waiting for you: he will put your logic to the test! And if that's still not enough for you, try to win all the secondary objectives.
